Elevator Control System

Two main classes:

1. Elevator Control System

- Has a reference to all the elevators in the system via an array
- Allows the retrieval of an elevator
- Has a method that allows updating of an elevator's attributes
- Given a pickup request, schedules a pickup for an elevator in the system
- Enables stepping through a simulation of the control system

2. Elevator

- Has getters and setters for accessing and modifying the attributes of an elevator
- Stores all scheduled dropoffs in two separate lists, one containing all dropoffs above the current floor and one containing all dropoffs below the current floor
- Contains an addFloor method that takes a dropoff location and inserts it into the correct position in the correct dropoff list
